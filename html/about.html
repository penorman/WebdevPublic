            <p>Liverpool Hope University pursues a path of excellence in scholarship
                and collegial life without reservation or hesitation. The University’s
                distinctive philosophy is to ‘educate in the round’ – mind, body and spirit
                – in the quest for Truth, Beauty and Goodness.</p>
                <p>Liverpool Hope University is distinctive in that it is the only university 
                    foundation in Europe (and the USA) where Catholic and Anglican colleges
                    have come together to form an integrated, ecumenical, Christian foundation. 
                    It has happened in Liverpool and nowhere else in Europe largely because 
                    of the presence in the 1980s of two remarkable church leaders: 
                    Bishop David Sheppard, the Bishop of the Anglican Diocese, 
                    and Archbishop Derek Worlock, the Archbishop of the 
                    Catholic Archdiocese that extends from Liverpool across 
                    the north of England. They confessed their faith to each 
                    other and took their congregations to visit each other’s 
                    cathedrals, a symbolic act of Christians working together 
                    in the context of northern Irish religious sectarianism.</p>
